1. Perform an extraction of abstract generic attributes and interfaces,
that you can identify in the article. Create the interfaces and abstract
and abstract classes that you think are appropriate according to the reading.

2. Create at least two abstract behaviors of a ship.

3. Create at least four different types of ships with different behaviors.
behaviors, if possible do an overloading and an overwriting of methods.
overloading and overwriting of methods.

4. Create a main class that allows to create the ships in such a way this
under a boolean condition or by means of a rule stipulated inside a switch-case or if-case.
a switch-case or if-else.

5. The program must have an infinite execution, until the user decides to terminate the program at any time.
terminate the program at any time.

6. With all the above, you must create an inventory type program of at least 3 ships of each possible ship.
3 ships of each possible ship, that is to say, if your analysis gave to create 3 types of ships, then you should have in inventory, at least, 9 ships of each possible ship.
3 types of ships, then you must have at least 9 ships in inventory.
ships.

7. The system must have sufficient methods to allow me to
search for one or more ships according to the characteristics of each ship.

At the end you must deliver a project that contains a main class to be able to add ships according to their characteristics and a
ships according to their characteristics and another method that has as an argument an object that can allow me to
argument an object that can allow me to filter either simple or advanced.
